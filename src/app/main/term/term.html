        </p>

        <p>

            <strong>3. Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access some features of the Service, you must
            register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide
            us with some information about yourself (such as your e-mail address or other contact
            information). You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will
            keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide
            a password. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords that use a combination of upper and
            lower case letters, numbers and symbols with your account. You are solely responsible for
            maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept
            responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason
            to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify
            us at Support@checklinked.com.

        </p>

        <p>
            Paid accounts (Organization Accounts) allow the account owner to add additional users
            and extend their subscription and have additional features not available to free individual
            user accounts. If an individual user desires the features available to the Organization account,
            then they can upgrade to a paid organization account and use it as a single person organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of the type of user you are, access is for your use only, and no other persons
            may access the Service using your account. You may not transfer or share your account with anyone, and we
            reserve the right to immediately terminate your account if you do transfer or share your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have the option to purchase subscriptions for other user accounts (“<strong>Additional Users</strong>”)
            that
            are associated with your organization you manage through the Service. If you purchase subscriptions for
            Additional Users, then you shall ensure that each such Additional Account is accessed only by the
            person that you have identified to CheckLinked as the user of that account, and by no other person.
            CheckLinked cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with
            the above requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. Payment.</strong> There are both paid accounts and free accounts. All organizations accounts are
            paid, and they
            come with additional features and the abilty to add users to the organization account. Free accounts have
            limited features and cannot add users to their account. They are essentially individual accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Subscription Fees. </strong> You agree to pay to CheckLinked all fees
            for subscriptions purchased by you or on your behalf, whether purchased on or through the Service or
            through a written agreement between you and CheckLinked, including in each case any applicable taxes (the
            “Subscription Fees"). Subscription Fees are nonrefundable (except as may otherwise be expressly provided
            herein). In the event of any change in the Subscription Fees applicable to the renewal of your
            subscription, CheckLinked will send you a notice of such change in advance of renewal (via a message on or
            through the Service or email). You must cancel a subscription prior to renewal to avoid incurring
            Subscription Fees for the renewal term. For clarity, if you are using the Service on behalf of an
            organization, your use of the Service may be covered under that organization’s agreement with CheckLinked
            and you may not be required to pay Subscription Fees. Also, you may be accessing the service though a free
            individual account and you may not be required to pay Subscriptions Fees.  

        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Subscription Billing.</strong> Subscription Fees will be billed upon the initiation (or
            modification) of your
            subscription, and will reoccur automatically either monthly or yearly after that, depending on the plan
            chosen, until you cancel the plan. (See Termination) For payment, CheckLinked will charge the payment
            method
            you specify at the time of purchase or at any later time and you authorize CheckLinked to charge all sums
            described herein to such payment method. If you pay any applicable fees with a credit card, CheckLinked may
            seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is
            valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

            Content . You acknowledge and agree that CheckLinked may also aggregate your User Content
            with data provided by other third parties and use and disclose such aggregated data for any business
