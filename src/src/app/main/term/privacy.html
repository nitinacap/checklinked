            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. <strong>If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use the Service or interact with any other aspect of our business.</strong> Where we provide the Service under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Service.

To understand how a customer processes your Personal Information, please refer to that customer’s privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the CheckLinked Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the CheckLinked Terms of Service.

        <p>
            Account Registration. If you register to use the Service, then you must provide us with your name, company name, email address and a password in order to create an account and user profile. You may also optionally add other information such as your phone number, job title, or other information that would be considered personal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>User Content.</strong> We will collect any information you post through the Service. For example, when you interact with other users by sending them messages, the Service will process the information you provide in such submissions, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your Content and metadata about your Content may be viewed by other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. CheckLinked can, but has no obligation, to monitor your Content you post on the Service. We can remove any information you post for any reason or no reason. Unless Content is made viewable in accordance with your settings on the Service, CheckLinked and CheckLinked employees will not view your Content except: (i) to maintain, provide or improve the Service; (ii) to help you and resolve your support requests; or (iii) as CheckLinked believes, in its sole opinion, is necessary to comply with or avoid the violation of applicable law or regulation or to cooperate with law enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Purchases.</strong> If you make a purchase on the Service, we will ask you to provide your payment information, such as your credit card number, so our service providers can process your payments.

CheckLinked stores this information to send this email, to register that person if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>b. Personal Information Collected via Automated Means</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to information that you provide to us, we may collect information about you and your use of the Service via automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to automatically collect certain information. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. When you use the Service, we may also automatically collect certain information from your device by using similar technologies, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons”. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your settings with regard to such automated data collection. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, such technologies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            The automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use this information to assess how many users access or use our Service, which content, products, and features of our Service most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see, and how our service performs from a technical point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Analytics.</strong> We work with Google Analytics and Zoho Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the website and report on activities and trends. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ , and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can learn about Zoho practices and their data polices at https://www.zoho.com/analytics/help/overview.html.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Third- Party Web Beacons and Third-Party Buttons.</strong> We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and CheckLinked does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Geo-Location Information:</strong> When you use the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey information about how you browse the Service to us. Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information about how you use the Service to us. A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. A device identifier may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. CheckLinked may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling CheckLinked’s Service.
        </p>

            <strong>c. Personal Information Obtained from Third Parties</strong>

        <p>
            Integrated Services. You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials (through Facebook Connect), or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Information or other information to us. We collect your Personal Information from such Integrated Service when you use your credentials for an Integrated Service to log into the Service. For example, when you log in with your Facebook credentials, we collect the information you have authorized Facebook to share with us, such as your name, email address, gender, date of birth, current city and profile picture. We may also obtain other non-public information with your permission. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.

            <strong>5. Third-Party Services</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies only to the processing of your Personal Information by CheckLinked. The Service may contain features or links to Web sites and services provided by third parties. The policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to Third Party Sites. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service.

            <strong>6. Children’s Privacy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Information has been collected on the Service from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at support@checklinked.com and request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. Data Security</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to appropriately protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession. WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US OR STORE ON THE SERVICE, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUROWN RISK. WE ALSO CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR MANAGERIAL SAFEGUARDS. The foregoing is subject to requirements under applicable law to ensure or warrant information security.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at support@checklinked.com.

            <strong>8. Data Retention</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

            <strong>9. Data Transfers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. By providing any information, including Personal Information, on or to the Service, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we transfer Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we will comply with applicable EU data protection laws. We may transfer your Personal Information to countries which provide an adequate level of protection under EU law, we may use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information or rely on a certification to the Privacy Shield framework. You may contact us as specified below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area.

            Note that as of the date the GDPR is new and not well understood nor has the implementation been tested to provide examples of compliance and non-compliance. We have attempted to comply as best as we can, given the information available. Nothing in these Terms should be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent or not comply with the GDPR and the associated laws and regulations.

            <strong>10. CheckLinked Blog & Community</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Service offers publicly accessible community services including blogs, and forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.

            <strong>11. Notice to End Users</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Service is intended for use by organizations or by individuals. Where the Service is made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Service and is responsible for the accounts over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Service is subject to that organization’s policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator’s organization, which may be different than this policy. Administrators are able to:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    require you to reset your account password;
                </li>
                <li>
                    restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Service;
                </li>
                <li>
                    access information in and about your account;
                </li>
                <li>
                    access or retain information stored as part of your account;
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, administrators can also:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
                </li>
                <li>
                    change the email address associated with your account;
                </li>
                <li>
                    restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if the Service is not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Service, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Service at a later date.  You may be notified if this happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Service, then set up your own account and do not accept the use of the service provided by that administrator. This will limit the use of the service as you will not be internal to that organization and you will have to pay separately. But your data will be your own and they will have no access to it beyond your control. If you have your own account, then you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile.  Once you have accepted being a user in an organization’s account, then administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Service, and you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.

            <strong>12. Links to Other Websites</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies.

            <strong>13. Changes and Updates to this Policy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
