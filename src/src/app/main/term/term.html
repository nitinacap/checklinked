            you and CheckLinked regarding your use of the Service and these Terms of Service shall not apply.

            removed from the Service; and (iii) that your registration and your use of the Service

        <p>
            <strong> 2. Use of the Service. </strong>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms,
            CheckLinked grants you a limited, non-exclusive nor, non-sublicensable right to
            use the Service solely in connection with your business operations Your right to use the Service is
            subject to and contingent upon your compliance with all limitations (such as the number of users,
            checklists, link connections, permissions for various features based on the type of account,
            amount of data storage, and any other restrictions that are associated with or determined by
            the subscription plan you have signed up for, regardless if the plan was a paid account or a free
            account, or have on CheckLinked’s website or via a mutually executed purchase order or other ordering document. Your use of the Service is also subject to your agreement and compliance with any and all end-user license agreements provided, as well as any acceptable use policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that we may post on or link to on the Service. All such end-user license terms, policies, rules and guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

        </p>

        <p>

            <strong>3. Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access some features of the Service, you must
            register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide
            us with some information about yourself (such as your e-mail address or other contact
            information). You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will
            keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide
            a password. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords that use a combination of upper and
            lower case letters, numbers and symbols with your account. You are solely responsible for
            maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept
            responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason
            to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify
            us at Support@checklinked.com.

        </p>

        <p>
            Paid accounts (Organization Accounts) allow the account owner to add additional users
            and extend their subscription and have additional features not available to free individual
            user accounts. If an individual user desires the features available to the Organization account,
            then they can upgrade to a paid organization account and use it as a single person organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of the type of user you are, access is for your use only, and no other persons
            may access the Service using your account. You may not transfer or share your account with anyone, and we
            reserve the right to immediately terminate your account if you do transfer or share your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have the option to purchase subscriptions for other user accounts (“<strong>Additional Users</strong>”)
            that
            are associated with your organization you manage through the Service. If you purchase subscriptions for
            Additional Users, then you shall ensure that each such Additional Account is accessed only by the
            person that you have identified to CheckLinked as the user of that account, and by no other person.
            CheckLinked cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with
            the above requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. Payment.</strong> There are both paid accounts and free accounts. All organizations accounts are
            paid, and they
            come with additional features and the abilty to add users to the organization account. Free accounts have
            limited features and cannot add users to their account. They are essentially individual accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Subscription Fees. </strong> You agree to pay to CheckLinked all fees
            for subscriptions purchased by you or on your behalf, whether purchased on or through the Service or
            through a written agreement between you and CheckLinked, including in each case any applicable taxes (the
            “Subscription Fees"). Subscription Fees are nonrefundable (except as may otherwise be expressly provided
            herein). In the event of any change in the Subscription Fees applicable to the renewal of your
            subscription, CheckLinked will send you a notice of such change in advance of renewal (via a message on or
            through the Service or email). You must cancel a subscription prior to renewal to avoid incurring
            Subscription Fees for the renewal term. For clarity, if you are using the Service on behalf of an
            organization, your use of the Service may be covered under that organization’s agreement with CheckLinked
            and you may not be required to pay Subscription Fees. Also, you may be accessing the service though a free
            individual account and you may not be required to pay Subscriptions Fees.  

        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Subscription Billing.</strong> Subscription Fees will be billed upon the initiation (or
            modification) of your
            subscription, and will reoccur automatically either monthly or yearly after that, depending on the plan
            chosen, until you cancel the plan. (See Termination) For payment, CheckLinked will charge the payment
            method
            you specify at the time of purchase or at any later time and you authorize CheckLinked to charge all sums
            described herein to such payment method. If you pay any applicable fees with a credit card, CheckLinked may
            seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is
            valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5. User Content </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> User Content Generally.</strong> Some features of the Service allow you to post or upload
            information, text,
            graphics, documents, photos, images, videos or other material (“Content” or, when posted by you, “your
            Content” or “<strong>User Content</strong>”), and to share your Content with others. You retain ownership
            of your Content,
            but there are many things that users may do with your Content, for example, copy it, modify it, re-share
            it, or broadcast it. CheckLinked has no responsibility for that activity. You understand that publishing
            your Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the
            Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization. Please consider carefully what you choose to
            share. As between you and CheckLinked, you retain ownership of all copyright and any other proprietary
            rights in the User Content that you post to the Service, and you do not transfer ownership of any
            intellectual property rights in your User Content to CheckLinked. In connection with providing the Service,
            we may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks
            and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content
            to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.
        </p>

            transfer, display and modify your User Content, in whole or in part, in any manner reasonably necessary to
            provide the Service. CheckLinked may also provide certain features in the Service that may allow you to
            configure certain controls or limitations with respect to if and how other users may access particular User
            Content . You acknowledge and agree that CheckLinked may also aggregate your User Content
            with data provided by other third parties and use and disclose such aggregated data for any business
            purposes, provided that such aggregated data does not identify you or contain any personally identifiable
            information of any individuals associated with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Limited License Grant to Other Users.</strong>By publishing or sharing User Content with other
            users through the
            Service, you hereby grant the recipient of such User Content a non-exclusive license to access and use such
            User Content as contemplated by these Terms and the functionality of the Service (including functionality
            that allows further sharing of such User Content).

            CheckLinked and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the
            licenses granted by you in this Section 5 and in the manner contemplated by these Terms; and
        </p>
        <p>

            will not violate rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or
            rights of privacy. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Content that we
            believe, in our sole discretion, violates these provisions.

        <p>
            <strong>6. Restrictions on Use</strong>. You shall not, and shall not permit or encourage any third party to: (a) alter,
            modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of
            the Service or any part thereof, except to the extent that such activities are permitted under applicable

            CheckLinked’s prior written consent; or (h) use the Service for any unlawful purpose. Any violation of any

            <strong>7. Third-Party Services and Linked Websites.</strong> CheckLinked may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including User Content, to third party services, including through features that allow you to link your CheckLinked account with an account on the third party service, such as Twitter or Facebook, or through our implementation of third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons). We may additionally allow you to link your account with other third-party services, such storage or integration services provided by Dropbox or Zapier. By using these tools, you agree that we may transfer such information to the applicable third-party service. Such third-party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any of these third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access a third-party website from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and our Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of those sites. You expressly relieve CheckLinked from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content and agree that your dealings with any third-party website, service, or content is only between you and such third parties.

            <strong>8. Termination.</strong> These Terms and your subscription for the Service will continue until the end of the subscription period you have purchased unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms. Thereafter, these Terms and your subscription will automatically renew for successive terms equal in length to the initial term of your subscription, unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms. If you violate any provision of these Terms, including your payment obligations under Section 4, we may immediately terminate these Terms or suspend your account. You may terminate your account at any time by contacting customer service at support@checklinked.com.

Each of us may also terminate this Agreement (i) if the other party terminates or suspends its business, (ii) becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becomes subject to direct control of a trustee, receiver or similar authority, or (iii) becomes subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under federal or state statutes. Additionally, CheckLinked may immediately terminate this Agreement and your use of the Service upon notice to you if CheckLinked, in its sole discretion determines to discontinue providing the Service to its customers generally, but in that case CheckLinked will provide you with a refund of any fees you may have pre-paid for the remainder of your subscription period. For clarity, access to the entire account may be suspended or discontinued if the User responsible for administering the account is suspended or terminated.
        </p>

            <strong>9. Changes to the Terms.</strong> We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms on a going- forward basis at any time.

In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such change. We may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Service, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an account, or through other mechanisms. Generally, modifications to the Terms are effective upon publication, provided that if the changed Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, the changes are effective upon the earlier of (a) your using the Service with actual knowledge of the change, or (b) thirty days following publication of the modified Terms, and further provided that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.

        <p>
            <strong>13. Limitation of Liability </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            IN NO EVENT WILL CHECKLINKED BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THE CHECKLINKED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. 
        </p>
        <p>
            YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE TOTAL OF ALL LIABILITY OF THE CHECKLINKED ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE) OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO CHECKLINKED FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO SUCH CLAIM. 
        </p>
        <p>
            SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
        </p>
        <p>
            EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>14. Governing Law.</strong> THESE TERMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and CheckLinked agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within the County of Alameda, California for the purpose of litigating all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and CheckLinked in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and CheckLinked agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CHECKLINKED ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Notwithstanding subsection 15.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Arbitrator. </strong>Any arbitration between you and CheckLinked will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting CheckLinked. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Notice; Process. </strong>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). CheckLinked's address for Notice is as set forth at the end of these Terms. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CheckLinked may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or CheckLinked shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, CheckLinked shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by CheckLinked in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fees. </strong>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, CheckLinked will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County in California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse CheckLinked for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Class Actions. YOU AND CHECKLINKED AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and CheckLinked agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Modifications.</strong> In the event that CheckLinked makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to CheckLinked's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to CheckLinked's address for Notice, in which case your account with CheckLinked shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Enforceability. </strong>If Subsection 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>16. Consent to Electronic Communications. </strong>By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us and other users as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>17. General. </strong>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and CheckLinked regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 1, 4, 5, 7, and 10 through 18.

            <strong>19. Privacy and Data Protection – Europe – GDPR. </strong>This Section 19 applies to the Processing of Personal Data subject to European Data Protection Laws by CheckLinked when it acts as a Processor (as these terms are defined below) in providing the Service to you or your organization (together “Customer”). This Section 19 prevails over any conflicting provisions in these Terms of Service. Note that as of the date of these Terms the GDPR is new and not well understood nor has the implementation been tested to provide examples of compliance and non-compliance. We have attempted to comply as best as we can, given the information available. Nothing in these Terms should be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent or not comply with the GDPR and the associated laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Definitions. </strong>In this Data Protection Act information, “European Data Protection Laws” means General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC) as amended or repealed from time to time, and their transposition into national laws of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom; and the terms “Personal Data”, “Data Subject”, “Processing”, “Controller”, “Processor”, and “Personal Data Breach”, have the meaning given to them in the GDPR
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scope. </strong>The subject-matter, nature and purposes of the Processing are described in these Terms of Service. CheckLinked will Process Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. The Processing will involve any category of Personal Data that Customer submits to the Service (including names and contact details), relating to Customer’s staff and any other Data Subjects whose Personal Data is submitted to the Service. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Roles. </strong>CheckLinked is a Processor on behalf of Customer and Customer’s clients; and Customer or Customer’s clients are Controllers. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges that CheckLinked may, as a Controller, Process Personal Data relating to the operation, support, or use of the Service for its own business purposes, such as billing, account management, data analysis, benchmarking, technical support, and product development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Processor Obligations. </strong>CheckLinked shall: 
        </p>
        <p>
            a. Process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by European Union or member state law to which the Processor is subject; in such a case, CheckLinked shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest; 
        </p>
        <p>
            b. ensure that persons authorized to Process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; 
        </p>
        <p>
            c. take all security measures required pursuant to European Data Protection Laws; 
        </p>
        <p>
            d. not engage another Processor without general written authorization of Customer, and CheckLinked shall inform Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other Processors, thereby giving Customer the opportunity to object to such changes. Customer hereby authorizes CheckLinked to engage other Processors. “CheckLinked’s current Processors are: Microsoft Azure, Sendgrid, Braintree, and Zoho. 
        </p>
        <p>
            e. when engaging another Processor to carry out specific Processing activities on behalf of Customer, contractually impose the same data protection obligations as set out in this Section; obtain sufficient guarantees that the Processing will meet the requirements of European Data Protection Laws; and remain fully liable to Customer for the performance of that other Processor's obligations; 
        </p>
        <p>
            f. taking into account the nature of the Processing, assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject’s rights laid down in European Data Protection Laws;
        </p>
        <p>
            g. assist Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to European Data Protection Laws to: implement appropriate security measures, to notify Personal Data Breaches, to conduct data protection impact assessments, and to engage in prior consultations with supervisory authorities, taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to CheckLinked; 
        </p>
        <p>
            h. at the choice of Customer, delete or return all the Personal Data to Customer after the end of the provision of the Service, and delete existing copies unless European Union or member state law requires storage of the Personal Data;  
        </p>
        <p>
            i. makes available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Section and European Data Protection Laws and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Customer or another auditor mandated by Customer. The auditor cannot be a competitor of CheckLinked, and the parties will mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit. Customer must reimburse CheckLinked for all expenses and costs for such audit; and 
        </p>
        <p>
            j. immediately inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes European Data Protection Laws. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data transfers. </strong>To provide the Service, CheckLinked needs to import Personal Data to the United States. Customer authorizes such cross-border Personal Data transfers and confirms and warrants that it will comply with any requirements under European Data Protection Laws with regard to such Personal Data transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Notices. </strong>All notices to CheckLinked under this Section shall be made via email at Support@CheckLinked.com. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Duration. </strong>This Section is terminated upon the termination of these Terms of Service, or of the Processing, whichever is later. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Indemnity and Liability.</strong> Sections 11 and 13 apply to the parties’ activities under this Section 19 to the fullest extent permitted under European Data Protection Laws.
        </p>
